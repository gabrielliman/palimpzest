Natural Gas Futures Dip Lower in Quiet Trading

    Natural gas for March delivery on the NYMEX dropped $0.043 to $2.074
per MMBtu yesterday. The April contract lost $0.032 to $2.152 per MMBtu.
The market dipped lower soon after opening higher and spent most of the
session between $2.10 - $2.12, but fell off sharply near the close as
locals sold down the contract to the $2.07 support level and went home
short. The AGA will release this week's storage report this afternoon, and
while some traders are predicting a very bearish less than 100 Bcf
withdrawal, look for the number to be closer to 120 Bcf. Cold weather in
the Midwest and Texas, the growing differential between cash and futures,
and the perceived premium in the early March contract have kept the market
from dropping further. Physical prices retained their premium over futures
yesterday on short-term cold weather at some pipelines, maintaining about
a $0.07 - $0.10 premium over the NYMEX. But cash traders expect the demand
to ease quickly as temperatures moderate by this weekend. As usual, the
market will look to the weekly storage report for short term direction,
but it is the massive amount of volumes still in storage compared to last
year that has put a cap on longer term price increases. Natural gas for
next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally flat to plus or
minus a few cents yesterday. Natural gas for next day delivery at the
Henry hub gained $0.02 to $2.20 per MMBtu.

Enron Executives Knew of Losses


    Enron's top executives and board of directors knew as early as March
that its off the books partnerships were losing money, according to
William Powers, dean of the University of Texas Law School who was
appointed Enron's board of directors to investigate the company. In
testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Powers said that
Enron had a $500 million loss in March. Rather than report it to
shareholders, Enron gave a partnership called Raptor another $800 million
in Enron shares. He said that there is no doubt that almost everyone, from
the board of directors on down, knew that the company was attempting to
offset investment losses with stock. The partnerships allowed Enron to
misrepresent earnings for a period spanning the 3rd quarter of 2000
through the 3rd quarter of 2001 by $1 billion. Powers told that committee
that over 70% of Enron's earnings for that period were false. He said that
there were red flags that should have alerted former chairman Ken Lay to
what was happening. Powers says that Lay definitely understood that Enron
was using its own stock to offset the losses in the partnerships.
