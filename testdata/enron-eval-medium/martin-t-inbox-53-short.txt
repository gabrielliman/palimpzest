Some Merrill Executives Had Stakes in Enron Partnership --- Investments Raise Conflict-of-Interest Questions

Nearly 100 Merrill Lynch & Co. executives invested more than $16 million of their own money in a controversial partnership the securities firm was selling for Enron Corp., even as other senior Merrill officials decided to turn down the offer, people close to Merrill said. 
Among the top Merrill officials who put their own money into the Enron partnership were current Vice Chairman Thomas Davis; Daniel Bayly, Merrill's investment-banking chief; and Schuyler Tilney, who heads Merrill's energy investment-banking department and directly oversees the firm's dealing with Enron on corporate-finance matters, the people said.
Though each executive invested less than $1 million, the people said, their involvement highlights the role played by senior Wall Street officials in helping to create some of the partnerships Enron used to pad its earnings and hide debt from investors -- and that eventually resulted in huge losses that led to the energy-trading company's downfall. 
Mr. Davis, Mr. Tilney and Mr. Bayly didn't return calls for comment. Joseph Cohen, a Merrill spokesman, said the investments were entirely appropriate, and common on Wall Street. 
The personal investments were part of a total of $22 million Merrill and its officials committed to invest in the partnership, known as LJM2 Co-Investment LP. This partnership was particularly controversial because it allowed some Enron officials to make far more money working part time on the partnerships than they did working full time for Enron. The energy company has estimated, for instance, that Andrew Fastow, whom Enron replaced as chief financial officer in October as pressures on the company mounted, made more than $30 million since 1999 running LJM2 and a smaller partnership, called LJM Cayman LP. 
At issue for Merrill is the potential for conflicts of interest. Merrill, like other Wall Street firms, wore a number of hats with Enron: The securities firm acted at various times as securities underwriter and investor with the energy company. Since 1990, Merrill was among the top five underwriters of Enron's stock and bond deals, according to Thomson Financial, earning fees for helping to raise about $3.7 billion in securities issues for the company. Thus, some critics question whether Merrill officials would let their personal investments with Enron entities interfere with their business decisions in dealing with the energy company. 
"Merrill's involvement as underwriter for Enron and its executives' investments raises serious conflict-of-interest questions," says Jacob Zamansky, a New York-based plaintiffs' lawyer. "It gives the appearance that Merrill did this to get Enron deals. Merrill had a vested interest in . . . the partnership and investing" in it. 
There are other conflicts as well, securities lawyers say. Some top executives at Merrill declined to invest their money because they believed that the Enron partnership -- which kept assets off Enron's balance sheet -- wouldn't get the best investments, which would be kept by the corporate parent. Another concern: Enron's Mr. Fastow suggested the idea of investing in the partnership to Mr. Tilney, whose wife until last week was a managing director of Enron's energy-services unit. Mr. Fastow through a spokesman had no comment. 
It is unclear if top Merrill executives, who also worked on Enron's financings, had more information about the nature of the LJM2 partnership than Merrill's individual customers who were offered opportunities to invest in the partnership. "I'm not saying that Merrill violated the law here," says John Coffee, a professor of securities law at Columbia University in New York. "But this is a big public-policy issue. Merrill has an obligation, because Enron is a client, not to reveal some confidential information, but it also has a fiduciary obligation to its investors to tell them if these securities aren't suitable for them." 
Mr. Cohen, the Merrill spokesman, brushes aside such concerns. "The investment partnership was reviewed and deemed appropriate by parties on all sides of the transaction," Mr. Cohen said, reading from a prepared statement. "Consistent with common industry practice, it was offered to qualified external as well as internal investors, and this is not a conflict of interest." 
Mr. Cohen added that Merrill high-net-worth clients "in the partnership offering were given the same information as all Merrill executives who wanted to invest." 
Mr. Davis, who at the time of the investment headed the institutional-securities group, appears to be the only official on Merrill's executive committee to have invested in the partnership. Even though close to 100 Merrill executives invested in the partnership, neither Chief Executive Officer David Komansky nor his heir apparent, President E. Stanley O'Neal, were in the group, people close to the deal said. One person with knowledge of the matter said some top executives balked at investing their own money because they were uncomfortable with some LJM2 investments. Mr. Davis, however, headed the institutional group, which counted Enron as one of its big clients. 
Merrill, which helped market LJM2 to more than three dozen institutional and individual investors, was only one of many Wall Street firms to invest in the $386.6 million partnership. Other corporate investors in the partnership included Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., two units of Credit Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Boston, Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., First Union Corp. and the CIBC World Markets unit of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. 
The funds for a $15 million investment from J.P. Morgan Chase came from the private-equity unit of J.P. Morgan, which invests the firm's own funds. While individual Morgan bankers may have stakes in those funds, they didn't have any direct, separate stakes in LJM2, a spokeswoman said. 
At Citigroup and Lehman Brothers, which committed $10 million each, and CIBC World Markets, which committed $15 million, the funds came from the firms' own assets and not from outside clients or individual investment bankers, according to people familiar with the investments. 
Officials declined to comment at CSFB, a unit of Credit Suisse Group, whose DLJ Fund Investment Partners III LP made a $5 million commitment, while a CSFB affiliate named Merchant Capital Inc. committed $10 million. Company representatives had no comment at Deutsche Bank, where an affiliate of its former Bankers Trust unit, BT Investment Partners, committed $10 million, and First Union, whose First Union Investors Inc. committed $25 million. 
Officials at some of these Wall Street firms said their investment committees felt pressured to make the investments in order to stay in the running for investment-banking assignments. Some bankers were concerned about whether they were being asked to make uneconomical investments in corporate castoffs that wouldn't appreciate in value. Indeed, it is unclear what returns, if any, the LJM2 partnership investment has generated for limited partners and investors. 
Wall Street securities firms have long made investments associated with their investment-banking business. Sometimes the investments are made to provide extra capital to help clients complete deals. Sometimes the investments are used to acquire an asset a client wants to sell. The funds may come from the securities firm itself, from investment clients, or individuals at the firm who may be offered the chance to make the investments as part of their compensation packages. 
What was unusual about the Merrill investment in the Enron vehicle was that some senior bankers chose not to participate out of concern about what the partnership would invest in. In addition, some of Merrill's top executives, including Mr. Komansky, Merrill's chief executive, had been embarrassed in 1998 by disclosure that they had taken personal stakes in Long-Term Capital Management, the highflying hedge fund for which Merrill had raised funds and whose near collapse jeopardized the entire U.S. financial system.

How to be an Enron millionaire
According to former colleagues, two executives reaped million-dollar windfalls by investing $6,000 apiece in the company's partnership scam. A case study in corporate rot.
- - - - - - - - - - - -
By Jake Tapper
Jan. 29, 2002 | When she heard that Kristina Mordaunt had been mixed up in Enron's infamous LJM partnership, Julia Murray broke down in tears. 
Murray, an Enron in-house counsel, wasn't known within the firm for such emotional displays. Enron was a hard-charging company that attracted tough-as-nails Type A executives and lawyers. But Kristina Mordaunt, a fellow Enron attorney who had worked in the counsel's office before joining the company's financial division, was Murray's close friend. And the news about her was rather shocking: On Nov. 7, 2001, Mordaunt was fired and escorted from the Enron building in downtown Houston by company security. According to four current or former Enron executives, Mordaunt was fired after the company found that she had made a windfall profit off LJM, one of the controversial -- and possibly illegal -- partnerships set up by Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
According to these sources, there is a lesson in Kristina Mordaunt's downfall. The ignominious exit of employees like Mordaunt, who had enjoyed the trust and respect of fellow company attorneys and managers, shows how Enron's corporate culture rotted from within, under the twin pressures of financial ambition and personal greed. 
A few weeks before Mordaunt was fired, Enron had announced that her former boss Fastow was on a "leave of absence." But few inside the company expected him back. On Oct. 31, Enron had reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission had upgraded its interest in the company's financial dealings from an inquiry to a formal investigation. Within Enron, the board of directors set up a special internal committee to investigate the company's convoluted finances as well. Soon, according to the four Enron sources, the committee stumbled upon stunning news: Working with Fastow, Mordaunt and Enron treasurer Ben Glisan had invested around $6,000 apiece in LJM, one of the limited partnerships Enron had established to hide its debt. Within a few weeks, they each made approximately $1 million from those investments. Enron later revealed that Fastow himself, the financial wizard behind the partnerships scheme, earned as much as $30 million from his role in managing the partnerships. 
Due to Enron's complex -- some think purposely confusing -- financial arrangements, those numbers could not be confirmed with documentation, though they were reported to Salon by the four current or former Enron executives. A congressional investigator also informed Salon that his committee has been given the same information and is currently trying to verify the charge. 
What is clear is that Mordaunt and Glisan were key members of the team Fastow worked with to set up these questionable partnerships, and they appear to have benefited dramatically. "Mordaunt, for all practical purposes, was Fastow's lawyer at Enron" since she was "the top lawyer in his division," at the time, said one former Enron executive. After working for Fastow, Mordaunt later became chief counsel for a separate Enron division called EBS -- which itself was involved in highly questionable accounting activities. 
Mordaunt could not be reached for comment by Salon, but according to a former Enron employee, "She has told people that she doesn't think she did anything wrong." 
Glisan declined to comment. "I've been advised not to talk to anybody," he told Salon. Glisan referred calls to his attorney, Hank Schuelke, with the Washington, D.C., law firm Janis Schuelke & Wechsler. Asked about the allegation against Glisan, Bill Shields, an attorney with the firm, said only, "We're not going to have any comment." 
So far, according to the congressional investigator, the world knows "just the tip of the iceberg" about what drove Enron, once the nation's seventh-largest company, into the biggest U.S. bankruptcy of all time, depriving investors and employees of at least $1 billion. Up to this point, most of the public's attention has been focused on Enron's political connections and the failure of Wall Street's so-called gatekeepers -- the analysts, banks, credit agencies and analysts -- to sound a warning bell. But the inside story of Enron's corporate culture -- as the company transformed itself from an energy trader whose business was rooted in the physical delivery of gas and electricity into a high-finance wheeler-dealer whose business was primarily manipulating numbers -- is just coming to light. This part of the story is about greed, betrayal and deception -- and its human costs, in broken friendships, ruined careers and worse. 
The apparent suicide of former Enron vice chairman J. Clifford Baxter on Friday might be the most dramatic example so far of this human cost. But Enron's corporate ranks have been suffering many shocks since last fall -- and the revelation about Mordaunt and Glisan was one of them. Many executives were stunned to learn that these two trusted co-workers and friends had been raking in such extraordinary amounts of cash. Though Julia Murray declined to comment to Salon, her tearful reaction to the news about her friend Mordaunt last November indicate the deep emotional wounds inflicted by some of Enron's suddenly rich managers as they grabbed their cash and ran for the door.
"Did I feel betrayed? Yeah, a lot," said an Enron executive and friend of both Mordaunt and Glisan who would speak with Salon only on the condition of anonymity. "I was extremely surprised." 
After the news about Mordaunt and Glisan broke inside the company, colleagues rushed to see who else might have been involved in the scandal. After Mordaunt was escorted out of the Enron building, said one executive, "I called a number of people I know who work in the finance division and said, 'Please tell me that you didn't invest in LJM!" 
LJM along with LJM2 and Chewco have become the most notorious of the shady accounting partnerships set up by Enron. Set up, it is now believed, specifically to hide Enron debt from public scrutiny, the partnerships proved to be the catalyst for Enron's fall. 
On Nov. 8, 2001, the same day the company announced that its financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 "should not be relied upon," Enron filed an "8-K" form -- an interim document required for certain types of financial events -- with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In that form, <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/> Enron disclosed that some of the "limited partners" in the partnerships "were, at the time of the investment, non-executive officers or employees of Enron." Enron also announced that it was "terminating the employment" of Glisan and Mordaunt for participating in the LJM partnerships. 
"At the time these individuals invested in the limited partnership, LJM1 had ceased entering into new transactions with Enron," Enron's 8-K stated. "However, some pre-existing investments involving LJM1 and Enron were still in effect, and Enron believes that these investments resulted in distributions or payments to LJM1 and to the limited partnership in which these individuals invested." 
According to the congressional investigator, Mordaunt reaped her LJM windfall after she was approached by an Enron executive, who asked her if she wanted to make some money. Yes, she said. "Give me a check for $6,000," he told her, according to the congressional investigator. Later, the executive asked Mordaunt for her bank account number so he could deposit the proceeds from her investment. "How much is it?" she asked. He told her to check her bank account the next day. When she did, she discovered over $1 million had been deposited into her account. The congressional committee is currently investigating the matter. 
The Nov. 8 SEC filing also clarified Fastow's role in the company. He was no longer officially on a leave of absence. He "is no longer working for Enron," the filing stated. 
At a November news conference, then-CEO Kenneth Lay reported that he knew about the partnerships but not about Mordaunt's and Glisan's role in them. 
Asked last week about the allegations against Mordaunt and Glisan, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said, "I have no idea." Palmer noted that a special committee had been appointed "to look into" such matters. "I know they're looking into everything surrounding those transactions," he said, referring to the partnerships. 
Said another former Enron executive after hearing about Mordaunt's and Glisan's lucrative deals: "Hillary Clinton should have gone to their school of futures trading." 
To many of their former colleagues, Mordaunt's and Glisan's closeness to Fastow's suspicious transactions makes things look even worse. "To many of us, this looks and smells like a bribe," said one Enron former employee. "'I' -- Fastow -- 'will give you money, you shut up.' Or put another way, 'Here is the payoff for helping me set up the structures that helped me rake in more than $30 million.'" The two weren't merely "Enron executives," the former employee says, "they were the treasurer and one of the top lawyers in the company. And both of them worked on LJM-related deals. That is what makes it sickening." 
The accusations highlight the personal betrayal many Enron executives feel. After Mordaunt and Glisan were fired last November, their former colleagues spent much time trying to figure out how it all could have happened. 
Mordaunt, according to a current Enron executive, "was very tight with Andy [Fastow]. Andy was responsible for making her managing director, and she would have done anything for him." Nonetheless, as a lawyer, Mordaunt should have known better, the executive said. "Given his connection with LJM, which was dicey at best and at worst probably illegal, I personally would have stayed far away from it. But you never know how Andy spun it to her." 
After working as Fastow's top lawyer, Mordaunt later served as chief counsel for EBS, an Enron subsidiary set up specifically to handle another complex partnership, code-named Braveheart. In Braveheart, Enron sold 10 years' worth of future revenue from a broadband interactive television deal it was setting up with Blockbuster. Although the deal itself never went past the testing stage, Enron booked $110 million worth of revenue for selling off those future, never-to-be-realized earnings. 
Glisan also played a key role in Fastow's division, a former Enron executive noted: "All the deals we did had to go through Glisan and get his approval because of the impact on funds flow." The former executive, like others affiliated with the firm, said that he once had a positive impression of Glisan and was surprised to learn that he had been an LJM investor. 
To some current and former Enron executives, the transformation of respected managers like Mordaunt and Glisan represented a major shift in the company ethos. "In my opinion this all goes back to when Jeff Skilling took over and Enron ceased being an energy company and we became an earnings company," said one former executive, referring to Enron's metamorphosis into a company that focused more on highly complex financial-derivatives trading than on actual commodities. 
In 1997, Skilling became the company's president and chief operating officer. Press accounts of Enron's rise traditionally gave him credit for Enron's increasing focus on complex financing schemes and risky leaps into such areas as bandwidth trading, an enterprise that ended up costing the company hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Skilling was "all hype," the one-time executive says. "Everything he did was to hype the stock. And they had this need to create complex financial dealings to hide all the things going wrong. 
"Once we became an earnings-focused company, that was the beginning of the end." The former executive said he's still unsure whether recently resigned CEO Lay knew everything that was going on. "But that doesn't excuse him. Captain Joe Hazelwood didn't know that the guy was going to run the Valdez into the reef. But he was Captain Hazelwood. It was his ship." 
The company's business practices changed under Skilling, this former executive said. And so did the attitudes of managers like Mordaunt and Glisan -- and Lay, for that matter. Keeping the stock price up, at all costs, became the order of the day, even if that meant telling employees all was fine, when in fact the company's situation was rapidly deteriorating. 
"[Lay] lied to us starting in August," said the former executive. "He lied to us." In August, Lay went before the company and announced that Skilling was resigning for personal reasons. In an all-employees meeting, Lay told a touching tale about why Skilling felt the need to leave the company. 
Skilling, Lay said, had recently visited the Teesside Power Station, Enron's gas-fired power plant in northeast England, where an Aug. 8 explosion and fire had killed three Enron employees. "It shook him up so much he realized how much he had sacrificed with his own family," one executive recalled Lay saying. "And he wanted to spend more time with his kids." Lay then told the company more lies, according to the executive: that Enron had just enjoyed the best quarter in its history; that it was going to be more friendly to Wall Street; it was going to simplify its accounting practices; there were no other people other than Fastow involved in the shady partnerships. 
"About two weeks later, the news came out about Ben Glisan and Kristina Mordaunt," recalled the executive. Soon afterward, the company was told that "we would have to restate our earnings for the past five years." 
Then came the news that executives like Lay had been dumping their stock for years while simultaneously telling stockholders and employees that all was fine and the stock would soon bounce back. In hindsight, few Enron executives believe that Skilling's departure had anything to do with the Teesside Power Station tragedy. 
"Lay got in front of the entire company and just lied," said the executive, who has lost his life savings. "I feel like a schmuck."

Enron Directors Backed Moving Debt Off Books

Members of Enron Corp.'s board of directors received detailed briefings as early as four years ago about the purpose and structure of controversial partnerships whose losses triggered the company's fall into bankruptcy, according to minutes of the meetings. 
The minutes, which cover four board meetings in 1997 and 1999 and three meetings of the board's finance committee in 2000, suggest that board members approved aggressive accounting actions, including moving debt off the company books.
A dozen congressional committees as well as the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating Enron's collapse, which cost investors and employees billions of dollars. A focus of the inquiries is whether Enron hid debt and inflated its profits by using the private partnerships run by its chief financial officer. 
In other Enron-related news yesterday, the General Accounting Office announced that it would sue the White House for access to records of Vice President Cheney's meetings with Enron and other industry interests that sought to influence the administration's energy policy last year. And Stephen Cooper, the interim head of Enron, said he was optimistic the company could survive, though in a much diminished form. 
Individual Enron board members, who themselves are being sued and investigated, have said little publicly about their role in the transactions that toppled the company. The minutes, made available to The Washington Post by a source critical of the board, suggest that the partnerships were a key part of Enron's growth strategy and show they were regularly reviewed by the directors. 
The copies of the minutes do not cover every board meeting and do not include documents that are referred to as being attached to the summaries of the board's actions. 
When it was reported last fall that Andrew Fastow, the Enron CFO, made $30 million running partnerships with names such as LJM, Raptor and JEDI, then-chairman Kenneth L. Lay announced that the board was setting up a special committee to investigate. The minutes show that members of that special committee attended board meetings in which Fastow described the intricacy of the entities. 
Sources said the committee's report, which is expected to be completed as early as tomorrow, will say that while the Enron board approved the partnerships, management and auditors withheld key information from them. That is expected to be the key element of the defense that will be offered by Lay and board member William C. Powers Jr. when they testify before Congress on Monday, sources said. Last night, Robert Bennett, a Washington lawyer representing Enron, gave every indication that would be the case. 
"While the board of directors, including Mr. Lay, were aware that these special partnership entities were being set up, which were being run by Mr. Fastow, there is a great deal of information regarding their operation and execution that was unknown to the board of directors," Bennett said. 
At an Oct. 11, 1999, board meeting, Fastow discussed the company's mix of "on-balance and off-balance sheet debt," according to the minutes. At another meeting on May 1, 2000, Fastow told board members about the risk of "accounting scrutiny" on the Raptor partnership. 
A board resolution in October 1999 said one purpose of the LJM2 partnership was to create "a potential ready purchaser of the company's businesses and assets." A chart labeled "LJM2 Update," attached to the agenda for a May 2000 finance committee meeting, said the partnership had made seven investments, all purchased from Enron. 
Enron has disclosed that the board waived the company's conflict-of-interest rules to let Fastow oversee the partnerships. 
The board's special committee hired William R. McLucas, former head of enforcement at the SEC, to do the investigation and write a report for the committee. The report is expected to be released before Lay, who resigned last week, and board member Powers, who is also dean of the University of Texas law school, testify before Congress on Monday. 
Until now, Congress has focused on the role Enron's outside auditor, Arthur Andersen, played in the company's collapse and the reported destruction by Andersen executives of Enron-related documents. Monday's hearings are expected to zero in on the behavior of Enron officials, including the board. 
The outside directors are expected, as part of their defense, to push the focus back on Andersen, sources say. They will point, for example, to portions of board minutes that say Andersen "had spent considerable time analyzing . . . the governance structure" of one of the partnerships, LJM2, and "was comfortable with the proposed transaction." 
Minutes from October 1999 and October 2000 say the board ordered several safeguards be implemented to maintain control of the partnerships. One was allowing Lay or the board to remove Fastow from one partnership, LJM, at any time. Another was directing then-Enron chief executive Jeffrey K. Skilling and others to review all transactions between Enron and LJM. And Skilling was to review Fastow's "economic interest" in the partnership. 
Bennett said, "We have learned that many of the procedures that were put into place to ensure the appropriate operation of these entities were not complied with, without the knowledge of the board." 
Patrick McGurn of Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. of Rockville, which advises large shareholders on corporate-governance issues, said last night that the minutes seem to provide more evidence that board members were fully informed of the company's aggressive financial strategies. 
"If that's not the case, the directors better start talking and start talking now. Every step along the way it seems this board had the opportunity to say no to the partnerships, to the waiver of the ethics code, and each time they had an opportunity to take the right fork in the road, they took the wrong fork." 
The Oct. 12, 1999, minutes show that outside director Herbert Winokur -- now a member of the board's special investigating committee -- recommended that the board approve Fastow's participation in the LJM2 partnership. 
McGurn said, "The first principle of an investigation is that the people who presumably might be held responsible at the end of the day can't investigate themselves." 
The other two members of the special committee -- Powers and Raymond S. Troubh, a New York consultant -- had no involvement with the company when the formation of the off-balance-sheet entities took place, sources close to the company said. 
W. Neil Eggleston, an attorney for the outside directors of the board, said Winokur has no conflict of interest in serving on that special committee, despite his role in approving the partnership deals. "It was important for the special committee to render its report quickly and Mr. Winokur's participation provided continuity and speed to the special committee's efforts," Eggleston said. 
The board minutes show that as early as Dec. 9, 1997, Enron's executive committee approved a buyout -- that included a corporate guarantee of $633 million -- of the interest of the California public employees pension fund in the JEDI partnership. 
At an Aug. 7, 2000, meeting of the finance committee, chaired by Winokur, the off-balance-sheet partnerships are described as "the vehicles the company was utilizing to manage its balance sheet debt." Directors Wendy Gramm and Lay were among other board members that also attended the meeting. 
At a special board meeting on June 28, 1999, Lay called on Skilling to discuss a proposed investment partnership. "Mr. Skilling noted that due to changes in the accounting treatment of off-balance-sheet transactions, the company had been analyzing new types of financing vehicles. He called on Mr. Fastow to discuss the proposal." 
Skilling resigned suddenly in August. Fastow was ousted in October. 
The LJM partnerships were specifically cited by the company last fall when it admitted violating some accounting standards, resulting in a $586 million overstatement of its profits between 1997 and 2001. 
The excerpts that became available yesterday give no hint that board members had questions or qualms about the accounting maneuvers, with the exception of Fastow's dual role as Enron's chief financial officer and LJM's manager.

Concerned ex-worker was sent to human resources
House panel asks Lay to explain what happened to memo from former energy services manager

WASHINGTON -- A one-time Enron Corp. manager who warned Chairman Ken Lay in August about questionable accounting practices was sent to human resources for a talk about employee morale, her attorney said Wednesday. 
House investigators demand Lay explain Enron's response to allegations raised in an Aug. 28 e-mail by Margaret Ceconi, who had lost her job with Enron Energy Services just over three weeks earlier. 
"Ms. Ceconi included her home phone number in the e-mail and offered to speak to board members," lawmakers from the House Energy and Commerce Committee said in a letter to Lay. "We are very interested in learning what happened to Ms. Ceconi's e-mail after you received it, and how Enron responded to it." 
An Enron spokesman did not return a call for comment. 
A key issue for investigators probing the collapse of Enron is at what point executives at the company became aware of financial problems and how those problems were addressed. 
Ceconi on Aug. 28 wrote a five-page memo to Lay, stating that losses in Enron Energy Services, or EES, were being moved to another sector of Enron to make EES appear profitable. 
According to Ceconi, the losses were hidden in Enron Wholesale Services, the company's highly profitable and well-established trading arm. 
"Some would say the house of cards are falling," Ceconi said in her memo to Lay. 
Demetrios Anaipakos, Ceconi's Houston attorney, said Lay never met with Ceconi to discuss her concerns, and she was instead referred to human resources. 
"During that meeting, the primary discussion was focused on concerns over employee morale at Enron," Anaipakos said. 
Ceconi's memo, which was copied to a manager in human resources, detailed morale problems and related issues at EES. 
Ceconi was told her accounting allegations would be taken seriously and investigated by Enron, but she never heard back, according to her lawyer. 
"Ms. Ceconi firmly believes the allegations she raised in her memo merited response from the company, and she didn't get one," Anaipakos said. 
The House Energy and Commerce Committee sent Lay 10 questions pertaining to Ceconi's memo and the company's response. Lay has until Feb. 12 to respond. 
Questions posed to Lay in a letter signed by Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin, R-La., committee chairman, and other members seek details on how the memo was distributed and whether Ceconi's allegations were investigated.
